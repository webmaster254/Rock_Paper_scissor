# Rock_Paper_scissor

rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:

-Rock smashes scissors.

-Paper covers rock.

-Scissors cut paper.
